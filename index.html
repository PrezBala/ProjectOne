        <h2>Who were the Shogun and the Samurai?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Shoguns were hereditary military leaders who were technically appointed by the emperor. However, real power rested with the shoguns themselves, who worked closely with other classes in Japanese society. Shoguns worked with civil servants, who would administer programs such as taxes and trade. They also worked with the daimyo, or wealthy landowners. Finally, shoguns worked with samurai, a warrior class who were usually employed by the daimyo.</p>
            <p class="lead">The samurai, members of a powerful military caste in feudal Japan, began as provincial warriors before rising to power in the 12th century with the beginning of the country first military dictatorship, known as the shogunate. As servants of the daimyos, or great lords, the samurai backed up the authority of the shogun and gave him power over the mikado (emperor).</p>

                    Samurai Armor
                </h3>
              
                <p>Unlike the clunky armour worn by European knights, the samurai armour was designed for mobility. A samurai armour had to be sturdy, yet flexible enough to allow free movement in the battlefield.

                    Made of lacquered plates of either metal or leather, the armour would be carefully bound together by laces of leather or silk.
                    </p><p>
                    The arms would be protected by large, rectangular shoulder shields and light, armoured sleeves. The right hand would sometimes be left without a sleeve, to allow for maximum movement.
                    
                    The samurai helmet, called a kabuto, was made of riveted metal plates, while the face and brow were protected by a piece of armour that tied around behind the head and under the helmet.</p>

                    Samurai Weapon
                </h3>
                <p>The samurai used a range of weapons, however their main original weapon was the sword, known as chokuto. It was a slimmer, smaller version of the straight swords later used by medieval knights.

                    As sword-making techniques progressed, the samurai would switch to curved swords, which eventually evolved into the katana.
                    </p><p>
                    The most iconic of samurai weapons, the katana was usually carried with a smaller blade in a pair called daisho. The daisho was a symbol used exclusively by the samurai class.
                    
                    The samurai would name their swords. Bushido dictated that a samurais soul was in his katana.</p>

                Difference between a Shogun and a Samurai?
            </h3>
           
            <p>The word "shogun" is a title that was granted by the Emperor to the country's top military commander. During the Heian period (794-1185) the members of the military gradually became more powerful than the court officials, and eventually they took control of the whole government. In 1192, a military leader called Minamoto Yoritomo had the Emperor appoint him shogun; he set up his own capital in Kamakura, far to the east of the Emperor's capital in Kyoto, near present-day Tokyo. </p><p>For almost 700 years after that, Japan was ruled mainly by a succession of shoguns, whose titles were usually passed on from father to son. Sometimes the shogun's family would become weak, and a rebel leader would seize power from them, after which he would be named shogun and would start a new ruling family.</p>
            <p>Shogun is the boss, Samurai were minions.

                To be more specific, the Shogun was the most powerful man in Japan for a long time, being the actual ruler of the nation while the Emperor was just a figurehead. He tended to be either the strongest warlord of the realm, or his son if he inherited it.
                </p><p>
                Samurai were the personal guards of lords (so they technically werent nobility themselves). They tended to be armed with a variety of weapons, including katanas (long swords), yari (spears), and naginata (halberds), and always with a shorter sword/dagger.
                
                And as a bonus fun fact, Ashigaru were peasants who served the lords and were conscripted to fight for a period of time, typically outside the times of harvest, though this was basically true for most medieval societies.</p>

# UX (User Experience)
## Website Owner Goals

The main purpose for the website is to serve as a central hub of information on the Samurai / Shogun Era of Japan. Through informative text and images/videos this will entice the user further on the history of Japan. With several images showcasing the armaments and also a contact us page so if users have additional questions or any queries they can contact the website host.

## User Goals
### First-time Users
+ The user can easily find all the necessary information across the home page with a video on the gallery page to further explain Samurais and Shoguns
+ The user can easily find the contact methods if they need to ask business about extra information via the contact us page and also through the footer 

## Wireframes
The following image shows a wireframe of each of the 4 pages of the site. These wireframes were created using [MockPlus](https://user.mockplus.com/signin?next=https://app.mockplus.com/app).

# Features

### Common Elements
The common elements across all 3 pages are the Header and Footer sections.

+ The Header- This sections appears across the top on all 3 pages and also contains a samurai helmet logo on the left. When selecting the helmet the user will return to the top of the homepage. The navigation menu is also positioned on the right. Both the logo and menu will respond to the screen sizes used. The navigation menu on certain phones will use a 'burger' style selection menu.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/header1.jpg">

+ The Footer - The section appears across the bottom on all 3 pages. There is a contact us section on the left with a button that will take the user directly to the contact us page. In the centre of the footer is the social links for Facebook,Twitter,Googlemail and Twitter and on the right is a samurai logo for aesthetics.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/footer1.jpg">

### Home Page
This is the main landing page which the user will be first presented with. By using a eye catching image and colours i hope to keep users interested in viewing the site. This page contains the following elements below:

+ Hero Image - The image spans across the full width of the page and very eye catching showing a samurai looking towards the direction of a cherry tree. I've also added text over the central part of the image with the name of the site 'Emperors Shogun' with smaller text 'and the samurai guards'.
This is in a font style which is in a japanese calligraphy style.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/mainimage1.jpg">

+ Descriptive text - This section is beneath the main hero image and highlights on three points. 'Who were the Shogun and the Samurai" the 'Samurai Armor' and the 'Samurai Weapon'. I've added text detailing each of the 3 sections and also added relevant imagery beside the texts. 

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/text1.jpg">

+ Secondary Hero Image - This image is added for aesthetic reasons to make the website more visually appealing and also to show an image of what the website is based on, to keep the user further interested.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/mainimage2.jpg">

+ Additional Descriptive text - This is the final descriptive text on this specific page, answering a question which is quite common for this part of Japanese history 'What is the difference between a Shogun and a Samurai' I've also added an image on the right side of the text for the page aesthetics.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/text2.jpg">

### Gallery Page

This is the second page of the website and showcases 17 images and 2 videos (linked to youtube). The images are arranged out in a grid area and each image when hovered over shows a text commenting on what the image relates to. I've also ensured when selecting the image this will open a new page allowing the user to view the image clearly. 

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/gallery1.jpg">

Further down the Gallery page, i've added text using the same Japanese calligraphy style/color i've used on the other page for consistency. The text advises the user to view the videos linked directly to youtuve for further information on the 'Life of a Samurai' and a quick 'Shogunate Japan in 2 minutes".

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframeScreenshots/gallery2.jpg">  

### Contact us page
This page clearly displays the contact details of the restaurant and also a contact form should the user wish to submit any queries in that manner.

The Contact us page contains a table which can be filled on the four sections. I ensured the background of the table matches the header/footer color for aesthetics and also the text to be easily visible. I've also incorprated a response for the email address field mentioning a '@' must be included before selecting the button 'Send Message!'

# Testing

## Cross-Browser Testing
I have tested this website across the 3 main web browsers used today, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge & Mozilla Firefox. The site loaded consistently across all 3 and no discrepancies were detected.

## Compatibility Testing
I tested the site across differing devices, such as the Nokia 4.2 smartphone with Android 11, Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop with different browsers on Windows 11, and on a Dell Studio laptop with different browsers on a Linux Mint operating system. No issues were reported between these devices.

## Responsiveness Testing
During development of this application, I regularly tested the responsiveness of the site using Google Chromes Developer tools. In my CSS media query rules, I used 3 separate break points to design the site for different screen sizes.

+ 800px width and below (medium screen size)
+ 600px width and below (small screen size)
+ 400px width and below (ultra small screen size)*

*Originally I had intended to use just the first 2 screen size breakpoints, however the main menu was not appearing as required using the 600px breakpoint so I added a smaller 400px rule.

## User Testing
All user stories and journeys passed successfully as all required content was available for both first-time and returning users to the site. The navigation was clearly accessible on both desktop and mobile screen sizes, and all information was presented on clearly legible texts with contrasting backgrounds. Graphic elements, while enhancing the look of the site did not detract from the user experience or distract the user while browsing.

### Contact The Restaurant
The one use case that needed a little extra testing was the contact form on the Contact page. The user enters the required details in the form, and if any of the fields were blank, the HTML5 validations would kick in as pictured below:

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/contact-validation.png">

Once all details were entered and the form submitted, the user is directed successfully to the Thank You page.

## Validator Testing

The HTML of the website was tested using the validator at [https://validator.w3.org/]. The following bugs were discovered:
+ Duplicate ID tags in Homepage "top-image" and "link-panel".
+ Trailing closing anchor tags which were leftover from deleting a previous anchor tag in development.
+ Duplicate ACTION attribute in the contact form html code, code was originally ACTION="POST" when it should have been METHOD="POST".

All of these errors were corrected and now the entire sites pages passes this validator.

The CSS was tested using the validator at [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] and no errors were reported.

## Performance Testing

I tested the website performance using Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools, and was satisfied with the results, varying from 95 to 100%. Results are seen below:

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/lighthouse.png">

## Errors, Bugs or Issues During Development

During development I wanted to use only 2 CSS breakpoints using media queries at 800 and 600px sizes. However the main menu was not rendering properly on some screen sizes below 600px. One method to rectify this was to further reduce padding and text size, but I found doing this would make the link text extremely small on screen sizes on the lower end of the 600px breakpoint. Thus, I introduced an "ultra small" breakpoint for screen sizes 400px and below. The error in question is shown in following image:

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/issue1.png">

This was rectified using the smaller breakpoint and the menu now displays properly on all viewports.

## Considerations for Improvements or Enhancements

During development of the project, I began to consider a couple of methods on how to improve this application in the future and also perhaps use these methods in other future projects:

+ Use "Burger" style menu for mobile screen sizes. This would take away the need to style the menu links individually for each screen size, thus the solution would be one burger style menu for all sizes under 800px width.

+ Use Flexbox or Grid for site structure. Throughout this application I positioned elements using floats and percentage widths, with margins and paddings in rem units. While I feel I achieved the desired results, a quick research of using flexbox and grid position would have cut my development time and is certainly worth considering for future projects, depending on project size and scope.

+ Ideally the "Back to Top" button on the Menu page should only appear after the user has scrolled down the page some ways, and not always be visible as it is currently. From my research this would be solved using a lot of complex CSS which I felt was outside my timeframe, thus a solution using JavaScript would be an ideal fix in future.

+ In the footer, there is text showing when the website was last updated, this is just hardcoded at the moment, but in a future version this website could be connected to a backend with programming scripts to auto-populate this piece of text with the current time and date.
